OVERVIEW

Thank you for your interest in Honeybrid.  I hope that you find it useful.


USAGE

Netfilter's functions are used to redirect traffic to honeybrid. For example, in an architecture like the following:

                          +=================+
+----------+              |eth0:192.168.1.1||
| attacker | ===========> ||   HONEYBRID   ||
|(internet)|              ||    1.1.1.1:eth1|
+----------+              +=================+
                           /            \
                          /              \
                     +--------+          +---------+
                     |honeypot|          | honeyd  |
                     |1.1.1.3 |          | 1.1.1.2 |
                     +--------+          +---------+

The following rules will queue the traffic from the attacker to honeyd and from honeyd to the attacker :
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth1 -s 1.1.1.2 -j QUEUE
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth0 -j QUEUE

don't forget to active the routing mode :
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

The connections between Honeybrid and the honeypot must not be queued.
